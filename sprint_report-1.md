## What's New (User Facing)
 * Stock Management: Implemented a backend system to track and manage inventory levels.
 * Store Tracking: Developed functionality to monitor and manage multiple store locations on the backend.
 * Employee Tracking: Created a backend feature to record and manage employee information.
 * Store Pages with Inventory Viewing: Built frontend pages allowing employees to view inventory details for each store.
 * Initial Graphical User Interface (GUI): Designed a preliminary UI to facilitate user interaction with the system.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this development cycle for our point of sale (POS) system, our team achieved several key milestones, though we didn’t accomplish 
as much as we had initially hoped. On the backend, we successfully built stock management, store tracking, and employee tracking 
features, establishing critical functionality for the system. On the frontend, we managed to create store pages with inventory viewing 
and an initial graphical user interface (GUI). However, this being our first time developing a program like this in Python, we 
encountered unexpected challenges—particularly with designing the UI and conducting thorough testing—which proved far more 
time-consuming than anticipated, limiting our progress despite our efforts.

## Unfinished Work
For our recent group project, we had planned to incorporate role-based access control (RBAC) into our point of sale (POS) system 
during this development cycle to improve its security and user functionality. However, we underestimated the time required to 
address some unforeseen challenges with other components of the system, which consumed much of our focus. As the deadline for this 
assignment approached, we had to make tough decisions about our priorities, and unfortunately, we ran out of time to implement RBAC. 
While it’s disappointing to delay this feature, we’ve decided to shift it to the next phase of the project to ensure it’s developed 
thoroughly and meets the assignment’s standards.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * The backend has been created in a way that it is easy to expand
  * The frontend linked up to the backend well
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Frontend UI 
   * More Features
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Role based access control
   * Transaction tracking
   * UI elements for above
