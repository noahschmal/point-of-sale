## What's New (User Facing)
 * Discounts
 * Logout
 * Login
 * Sales Report Visualization
 * Store tax rate context menu

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Transactions that are returns also include discounts now. A file dialog was added for saving the sales reports. Store's tax rates are able to be set using a context menu. Employee names are shown in the employee dropdown when logged in. The discount page was added along with the ability to add them on the sales page.

## Unfinished Work
The only functional requirement we didn't complete was a customer system. We decided that the scope of implementing customers was large enough to be its own project entirely.
