## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint we worked together to implement the basic necessities to create a functional application for end users which allowed our app to be 
useful as a pos system. While there are still issues that are being worked on specifically about role based access and other more complex systems the 
majority of our aplications core functionality has been completed. This features did have many bugs before they could be completed. But this was somewhat
easily solved through the use of test driven delvelopment on the backend. 

## Unfinished Work
We were hoping to create a discount system which is currently in development on both the front and backend. There were also some UI improvements that are in
active development.

 	Adding discounts during this sprint was a little bit ambitions and was just out side of the scope of this sprint. This was not total unexpected
	as we wanted to add more things to this sprint than we though would be possible to give flexibility during blocking issues.
